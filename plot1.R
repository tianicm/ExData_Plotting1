# JM Stewart
# Exploratory Data Analysis-Course Poject1:Plot1
# For each plot you should:
# Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
# Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
# Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R 
# constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. 
# You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
# Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)
# When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. 
# There should be four PNG files and four R code files, a total of eight files in the top-level folder of the repo.
